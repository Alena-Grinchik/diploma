feedback.text1=I found out about this place recently, about a month ago. Now I often come here with my family, friends and myself. The food here is delicious and you are warmly welcomed. I even managed to break the stereotypes of my friends about veganism: now they know that I can treat myself too. But without fried, boiled and dried - without harming yourself and the animal world. At Dill, vegetarianism is the basis of the cuisine, and not some poor item on the menu. So I definitely recommend this cafe.
feedback.text2=While looking for the best deal, I came across several establishments. Visited each cafe to compare. I ended up staying here and have already ordered my favorite dish 2 times already - beans with artichokes. In favor of "Dill" played its location (5 minutes from me) and, of course, the kitchen. The quality of service is not bad, the menu is surprisingly rich. I plan to order food from here in the future. Thanks to the Dill team, they did not disappoint.
feedback.text3=I live alone, I often come here after work to eat. Well, I take food home too. The good news is that the costs at the end of the month are tolerable, since the prices are pleasant. Of course, I also look at the quality of the food and the performance of the staff. So far I haven't noticed any omissions. Only once the courier was late for 5 minutes, but during this time I was not very hungry. And in the end I got my couscous with vegetables at a price 2 times less. The guys keep their word, you can trust)
feedback.text4=I am writing this review based on my first impression. Saw an ad on social media and came here the other day. I can say with confidence that the promises of "Ukrop" and my expectations coincided. I really got delicious food and convenient service at a reasonable price. I specially ordered the familiar pumpkin lasagna to test the local chefs. Usually I don't give places a second chance, but I didn't need to give one here. Everything was made just the way I wanted it, no modifications. And the waitress gracefully refused my tip: she said she will accept it when I come again. Well, I will definitely come back again)
